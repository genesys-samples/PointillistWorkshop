# Qualifying Questions to ask of the Contact Center


## How effective are your self-service channels? 

- Your customer may prefer to use your self-service channels, but as long as the experience is positive. Do you know how many people are deflecting from self-service solutions and picking up the phone? This switch to a live channel can cost your contact center a lot of money in the long run. 

## Why and how often are customers escalating to live agents? 

- Several factors can contribute to agent escalations. You may not be providing a human like personalized experience that the customer feels from a voice interaction. Empathy is bridging that gap between self-service and automation. 

## Which interaction types are driving up costs, repeat calls, or agent to agent transfers?

## Do you have a plan to optimize your feedback channels? 

## Which customer behaviors impact key metrics and how? 

- Customer Loyalty, retention rate, conversion and churn, Customer lifetime value, qualitative customer feedback, CSAT & NPS scores. 

## How are you measuring the success of your self-service and digital investment?

## Are you engaged with clients in Customer Experience or Enterprise Analytics/BI roles? 

## Are your contacts thinking and talking about improving and managing cross-channel customer journeys? 

## Are your contacts trying to drive digital containment and, in turn, reduce agent-assisted calls and chats?
