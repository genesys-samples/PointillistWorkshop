## There are Four methods for adding data to Pointillist

### Third-party API

Pointillist has a library of existing connectors to third-party SaaS platforms. However, because large enterprises often heavily customize their instances for highly specific use cases, Pointillist typically accounts for some level of custom development when planning such integrations. 

### Partner integrations

Pointillist has access to deeper levels of integration with its technology partners, enabling capabilities beyond those available via the public web services. Check Pointillist’s current partner list for more information. 

### Streaming data API

Event data may be streamed directly to Pointillist’s RESTful web service. This data is immediately processed by the platform and is made available for measurement, analytics, and orchestration/RTIM (real-time interaction management). 

### Bulk file transfer

Pointillist accepts a variety of file types and can accommodate data represented in both tabular and JSON formats. The platform’s data transformation UI gives full control over, and transparency into, the mapping and cleaning of bulk files. Data can be transferred via SFTP, NDM/Connect:Direct, S3 or Box.
