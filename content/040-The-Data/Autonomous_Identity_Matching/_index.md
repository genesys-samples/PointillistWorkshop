## Bring it all together through an Autonomous Identity Matching System

In order to get real-time insights, there is a need to capture, ingest and process customer data effectively and rapidly across multiple channels and millions of data points. Building a repository of cross-channel customer events used to be a labor-intensive process requiring extensive data engineering and complex ETL processes to join disparate customer datasets into clean, unified customer profiles. Pointillist’s Autonomous Identity Matching (AIM) alleviates this burden by automatically connecting events from disparate channels by using the best available data at all times. 

### How it Works

Customer data enters Pointillist from different sources such as data warehouses, point-of-sale systems, email marketing platforms, marketing automations systems, call center data management systems etc. This data can include demographics, web and mobile browsing activity, customer preferences, sentiments, support team interactions, firmographics, social, transactions and sales team activity among others. Pointillist can integrate this data rapidly and easily without first requiring customer identity matching, schema setup or fixed field mappings for different event types. Our built-in ETL capabilities allow you to extract data from your system in the format that is easiest for you to use.

### Customer Identity Matching

Pointillist’s unique customer identity matching system was built to merge data into unified identities at a rate of 18,000 events per second – or 2.5 billion events per day. Every event entering Pointillist contains identifiers of who and what participated in the event. This might include: 
- Email address, credit card number, transaction ID, or IP address for customers. 
- Agent name or agent ID for customer care representatives.
- Account number, company name, or salesforce ID for business accounts, etc.
