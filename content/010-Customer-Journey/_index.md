# What is a Customer Journey?


Interactions within your contact center are just one part of a customer journey. It’s crucial to understand end-to-end journeys to identify the drivers of contact center outcomes. A customer journey encompasses the series of steps customers take with your organization — within and beyond the contact center — to achieve a goal. To measure and improve contact center experiences and operations, you need to connect the dots. Customers view what they do before and after they engage with the contact center as one experience with your organization. This way, you can easily answer questions such as:

- When do your customers use self-service channels? 
- Why do they switch to agent-assisted channels?
- Which journeys are driving up costs the most?
- Which behaviors affect key metrics? How?

Journeys can also enhance approaches you already use, like text and speech analytics. Combining what customers are doing with why they’re doing it gives agents the actionable information they need to deliver consistent, high-quality service across every channel. Monitoring what happens before, during and after a contact center interaction gives you the information you need to prioritize CX improvements and cost saving initiatives. Rather than simply monitoring their KPIs by channel, customer-centric leaders track them by journey. This includes what happens before their customers reach the contact center and what happens after an agent addresses their inquiry.
