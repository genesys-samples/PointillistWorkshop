## Installing the Timeline Extension 



This instruction is going to teach you how to set up the Timeline plugin for Pointillist. We will be using a dedicated zip file to complete this step found HERE. 

In the Google Chrome browser settings, open the tab “More Tools” and select “Extensions.” Make sure to set the settings to “Developer Mode”

You should now see within your list of Google Chrome extensions, the Pointillist Lab Extension. Once you do, turn the developer key “off” so you can verify the extension inside Pointillist.

Open up GDemo through the Pointillist solution and select a journey to test the plugin success. Once inside the chosen journey, click on “extensions” in the top right Chrome ribbon. Verify that the Pointillist Lab extension is “active” by highlighting the thumb tack icon.
