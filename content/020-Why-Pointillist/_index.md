## Why Pointillist

Contact center leaders are under pressure to increase customer satisfaction, improve performance and lower costs. In a world where customers expect a personalized experience on any channel they choose, contact center teams struggle to deliver experiences that anticipate each customer’s needs by recognizing their preferences, prior experiences, and current goals. 

That’s why customer-centric organizations rely on the Pointillist Contact Center Optimization Solution to improve every contact center experience, increase customer and employee satisfaction, boost contact center performance, and reduce cost to serve.

### Contact center operations depend on Pointillist to:

- Measure & monitor omnichannel experiences both within and beyond the contact center.
- Identify the drivers of poor contact center experiences and performance issues.
- Deliver frictionless and connected omnichannel contact center experiences by bridging the gaps between chat, voice and IVR.

Contact centers apply speech and text analytics tools to analyze interactions through their IVR, chat and call systems. Analysts rely on this technology to comb through interaction recordings to create transcripts, identify common call drivers, flag potential compliance issues and more. 

Leaders often rely on natural language processing (NLP) to better identify customer intent and improve call dispositioning. This technology can help agents understand why customers have reached out — but not what steps they’ve taken, or which channels they leveraged before reaching out for help.

However, these analytics solutions typically are restricted to contact center-specific channels. The rapid analysis and high accuracy of NLP is beneficial but cannot provide the context of what customers were doing before and after they speak with an agent. 

It’s essential to know what customers are doing in other channels and which goal they’re trying to reach. Otherwise, it’s incredibly difficult to deliver intuitive and empathetic experiences that are also efficient and scalable.
